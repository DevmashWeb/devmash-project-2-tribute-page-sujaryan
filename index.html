      <center><h4>Early Life</h4></center>
      <p>Bryant was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the youngest of three children and the only son of Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. He is also the maternal nephew of basketball player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, is derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean". Bryant was raised Roman Catholic. When Bryant was six, his father left the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball. Bryant became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian.During summers, he would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league.</p><br>

<p>Bryant started playing basketball when he was 3 years old, and his favorite team growing up was the Lakers. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games, which Bryant would study. At an early age he also learned to play soccer and his favorite team was A.C. Milan. Upon Joe Bryant's retirement from playing basketball in 1991, the Bryant family moved back to the United States.</p>
      <CENTER><h4>Player Profile</h4></CENTER>
      <p>Standing at 6 feet 6 inches tall (1.98 m) and weighing 205 pounds (93 kg), Bryant primarily played as a shooting guard. Able to create a decent shot at any time, he is often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA. Bryant has drawn frequent comparisons to Jordan, after whom he modeled his playing style. Like Jordan, he became most known shooting a fall-away jump shot. Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated describes another of Bryant's most famous moves as the "jab step-and-pause": Bryant jabs his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax and instead of bringing the jab foot back, pushing off it and driving around his opponent to get to the basket.</p><br>
